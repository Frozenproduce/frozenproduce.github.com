  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m writing this sat in the International Departures lounge at Vancouver
International Airport (YVR). All I can hear is the sound of running water, and
the occasional passenger announcement. Out of the window I can see the snow
covered tops of the nearby Coastal Mountains glistening in the spring
sunshine. The sky is clear and the winds calm, It really is a perfect day.</p>

<p>Part of me is very excited to go back to the UK, but a part of me will always
long to be in this beautiful area of the world. I&#8217;ll be back Vancouver! But
it&#8217;s time for my next adventure. I&#8217;m just not looking forward to the grimy
80&#8217;s era international arrivals hall at Heathrow, that&#8217;ll be a serious shock
to the system!</p>

<p>And to anyone thinking of making the five-thousand mile trip, do it! You won&#8217;t
be disappointed!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As winter slowly turns into spring it&#8217;s time to end my Canadian adventure. For
those of you that don&#8217;t know, I&#8217;ve been living in Whistler, BC for the last
four months. These have been some of the best four months of my life. I have
met so many great people, and hung out with some of my best friends while I&#8217;ve
been here.</p>

<p>Whistler is one of those places that everyone who lives here is on the same
wavelength, it&#8217;s unbelievable how easy it is to get on with anyone when you
have so much in common. I guess that&#8217;s why I enjoyed <a href="http://leedsmetsnowsports.co.uk">university
snowsports</a> so much, as everyone had the same
approach to life, doing anything to get the next fix of snow! I really hope I
will see a lot of the people I have met over here again.</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_liuxbeoQTx1qeg2ip.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>In terms of resorts, Whistler is one of the most complete resorts I have ever
been to, the village is great, plenty to do and see even if you don&#8217;t ski or
snowboard. Well thought out, everything is within walking distance, plus great
transit links provided by BC Transit to the surrounding area. Topped off by
some great bars and restaurants, in no particular order here are my top five.</p>

<ul>
<li>The Garibaldi Lift Company (The GLC)</li>
<li>Crystal Lounge</li>
<li>Dustys</li>
<li>Merlins</li>
<li>Earls</li>
</ul>


<p>The mountains of Whistler and Blackcomb have some of the best terrain in North
America, probably the world, steep chutes, great glades, drops, expansive
alpine bowls. The only problem with the area, and the Coastal Mountains in
general is its proximity to the Pacific, this gives Whistler quite a mild
climate, it can rain in the village, and we only had a couple of bad days
where it rained all the way to the high alpine. But when it snows, does it
snow! The base as of the 30th of march is 3.5 meters, 3.5 meters is an
incredible amount of snow, total accumulations this season have been in excess
of 1,300Â cm, so as you can imagine we&#8217;ve had some epic powder days! In no
order here are my top five areas of both mountains that you must visit if you
come to Whistler.</p>

<ul>
<li>Fraggle Rock (Skiers right off under Crystal Chair)</li>
<li>Harmony Horseshoes/Boomer Bowl/Gun Barrels</li>
<li>Flute Bowl (Far skiers right off Symphony + 25 minute hike)</li>
<li>Gemstone Bowls (Off Spankies Ladder)</li>
<li>Sun Bowl (Off Harmony ridge)</li>
<li>Almost anything off 7th Heaven (Reservoir Trees, Xhiggies Meadow)</li>
<li>Khybers/Million Dollar Ridge (Out of bounds, skiers left off upper peak to creek)</li>
</ul>


<p>I could go on and on, but as you can see it&#8217;s just endless, I have been here
four months and haven&#8217;t even done all of the marked in bounds runs!</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_liuxc0n8IT1qeg2ip.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>I&#8217;m going to miss Whistler, but I&#8217;m very excited to what the future will hold.
I have an interview for a great position in London, and an interview for a
position to volunteer for the London 2012 Olympics. But no doubt I&#8217;ll be back
to Whistler next winter to see all of my friends out here and to tick off the
rest of the areas!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m as shocked as anyone else regarding the devastation in Japan, the scale of
the human tragedy is inconceivable, however the main story that seems to be
circling the news, especially in Canada, is that of this supposed &#8220;Meltdown&#8221;</p>

<p>Now first of all, Meltdown conjures up images of Chernobyl and the abandoned
town of Pripyat. To use the same term and toss it around so loosely regarding
the incident at Fukushima is reckless. They are nowhere near the same type of
incident, and to draw comparisons is tantamount to disinformation.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_li37fyobvI1qeg2ip.jpg"></p>

<p>The main issue in my opinion is a general ignorance as to the workings of a
nuclear reactor, and nuclear physics in general. People are terrified of
things they don&#8217;t fully understand, and nuclear power, unfortunately, is one
of these things.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s not helped by the media supplying incredibly anti-nuclear commentary,
referring to everything as a disaster, or &#8220;meltdown&#8221;. Nuclear power when
managed correctly is incredibly safe and clean, producing no carbon emissions
at all, the only waste is nuclear byproducts that can be stored underground to
decay into more stable elements.</p>

<p>For example, the media was reporting yesterday that that Fukushima I was
venting radioactive steam, however what the media failed to mention is that
the steam contains radionuclides with very short half-lives, so after they
were vented they rapidly decayed into stable, non-radioactive elements.</p>

<p>A half-life is not something the media concerns itself with it&#8217;s content to
allow people to believe that this steam is lethal, even though the amount of
radiation measured during the venting was equivalent to that of a chest x-ray,
not to mention that those elements will rapidly decay and be sent out to sea,
never to be seen again!</p>

<p>The real danger comes from cracked containment vessels, as was shown with the
obsolete RBMK reactor types responsible for the Chernobyl disaster, however
the BWR reactors at Fukushima have 3 levels of containment, the zircaloy fuel
rod sheathes, the concrete core vessel, and then the outer containment vessel,
even if the fuel rods melt down, they will not breach the containment, and it
will not continue burning through the planet.</p>

<p>The future of nuclear power is a difficult one, its about overcoming peoples
innate fear of something they don&#8217;t fully understand, coupled with the media
fanning the flames. However if we all want to keep using the same amount of
electricity, and we&#8217;re committed to doing all we can to save the planet then
we need to start the process to ditch our carbon economy.</p>

<p>The first step comes with replacing our dirty fossil fuel burning power
stations with clean nuclear power. Renewables are great, but they don&#8217;t
produce the amount of power required to run nations, nuclear fission power is
our best bet for staving off the effects of climate change in the immediate
short term, while we develop ways to bring nuclear fusion reactors up to
industrial scale. To put a halt on all nuclear power developments would be
incredibly short sighted. After all, we all need electricity, where else are
we gonna&#8217; get it from?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>If you, like me, have tried to use helpers to generate complex chunks of HTML
programmaticly, then you will have noticed that <code>content_tag</code> doesn&#8217;t really
cut it for large chunks of HTML</p>

<p><code>content_tag</code> will render the HTML inline unless you manually insert line
breaks and tabs in order to make it readable, not to mention you end up with a
horribly nested set of methods wrapping around the content you want to display</p>

<p>Looking something a little like this</p>

<p>As you can see the code looks quite unreadable, and it&#8217;s almost backwards in
the way that it is generated, I&#8217;m creating the inner HTML first, and then
wrapping it inside a div depending on if the user is logged in or not, there
must be a better way to achieve the same result, while making it look nicer</p>

<h2>Enter Builder</h2>

<p>The builder gem is something that I have used most often for defining XML
documents, however you can also call the Builder::XmlMarkup.new method within
any other methods and generate XML markup inline. Using the same example, this
is the execution using Builder::XmlMarkup instead of content_tag</p>

<p>As you can see it&#8217;s much more readable than the previous example</p>

<p>However each to their own, but I think personally the Builder gem is
incredibly useful for creating XML style markup instead of using Rails&#8217; built
in helpers to generate HTML. Give it a go, you might be pleasantly surprised!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&#8220;Yay cloud&#8221;, exclaims the happy girlfriend.</p>

<p>For those of you that haven&#8217;t seen it, the advert is set in a busy airport
departure lounge, with a bored couple who have just been informed that the
flight is delayed for another hour. Enter Windows 7 cloud services! The
boyfriend connects to his home machine, looks at the media library and decides
on a show to watch.</p>

<p>This show is then streamed over the network and the couple watch in bliss!</p>

<p>However I&#8217;m just a little concerned as to how this actually works, if it is
stored on your hard drive at home then how would you get enough upload
bandwidth to stream the video? I just ran a quick test here in Whistler, I get
0.8mbps up however the average bitrate (depending on codec) for the majority
of videos I watch is 1mbps up. Not to mention the network overhead that goes
with any TCP/IP communication</p>

<p>So that&#8217;s a little short, unless Windows does some excessive compression, or
it uploads your movies to a location held by Microsoft overnight, If so I
don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;d be too happy with that!</p>

<p>I may well be wrong, and missing some crucial piece of information, I just
find it a little implausible!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have recently upgraded my slicehost box to Ubuntu 10.04 LTS, and upgraded
the Passenger version to 3, the difference in performance is incredible, at
least a 20% decrease in response times.</p>

<p>However the big great news is the inclusion of a new Apache directive,</p>

<p><code>PassengerMinInstances</code></p>

<p>Previously passenger would spool down all of the running instances of an app
if it was idle for too long, you could override this behaviour by setting
PassengerPoolIdleTime to 0, however this would mean that spawned instances
would never spin down, utilising the server even if it was getting no traffic,
however on the flip side it meant that application initial load times were
kept to a minimum</p>

<p>The new directive allows Passenger to load the Rails framework into memory on
the first application hit, and because all the processes will not spin down
after that no matter how long between requests the page load will be near
instantaneous</p>

<p>For me this was the only thing that made Passenger an issue, and clients often
complained about the long load times, however with Passenger 3 this load time
is negated to the first time the app is loaded after an Apache restart</p>

<p>If you haven&#8217;t already I recommend that you upgrade all of your existing
Passenger implementations to version 3</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So, I was working on a project a while ago with user comments, and wanted each
person to have their own avatar, however, the Gravatar plugins that existed
for Rails seemed a bit too much overkill for my needs.</p>

<p>So I wrote this simple helper method. Either copy the method into your
application_helper.rb, or alternatively drop it into your lib directory and
include it.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
<span class='line-number'>11</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="k">module</span> <span class="nn">GravatarHelper</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">gravatize</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">email</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">options</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="p">{})</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="n">default_options</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">{</span><span class="ss">:size</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="mi">60</span><span class="p">}</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="n">options</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">default_options</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">update</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">options</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="n">crypted_email</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">Digest</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="no">MD5</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">hexdigest</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">email</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="n">output</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">&quot;http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/</span><span class="si">#{</span><span class="n">crypted_email</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2">?s=</span><span class="si">#{</span><span class="n">options</span><span class="o">[</span><span class="ss">:size</span><span class="o">]</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2">&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">image_tag</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">output</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">end</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Usage is as simple as just calling:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="n">gravatize</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">user</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">email</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:size</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="mi">50</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This will just render the Gravatar inside an image tag, simple no!</p>
