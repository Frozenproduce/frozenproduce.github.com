title: Windows cloud advert is bogus

"Yay cloud", exclaims the happy girlfriend.

For those of you that haven't seen it, the advert is set in a busy airport
departure lounge, with a bored couple who have just been informed that the
flight is delayed for another hour. Enter Windows 7 cloud services! The
boyfriend connects to his home machine, looks at the media library and decides
on a show to watch.

This show is then streamed over the network and the couple watch in bliss!

However I'm just a little concerned as to how this actually works, if it is
stored on your hard drive at home then how would you get enough upload
bandwidth to stream the video? I just ran a quick test here in Whistler, I get
0.8mbps up however the average bitrate (depending on codec) for the majority
of videos I watch is 1mbps up. Not to mention the network overhead that goes
with any TCP/IP communication

So that's a little short, unless Windows does some excessive compression, or
it uploads your movies to a location held by Microsoft overnight, If so I
don't know if I'd be too happy with that!

I may well be wrong, and missing some crucial piece of information, I just
find it a little implausible!
