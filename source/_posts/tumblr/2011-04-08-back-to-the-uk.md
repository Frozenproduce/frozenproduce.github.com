So after four months in Canada I've finally made it home and I'm settling back
in to work after having so much time off. I've been all over the country in
the past week attending interviews for various positions.

I attended an interview in Manchester to work as a volunteer for the London
2012 Olympics, I probably talked far too much, but it was great fun to talk to
a bunch of people who were really passionate about what the Olympics is going
to bring to the UK. I've heard nothing but negative reaction in the press
regarding the 2012 games, but I think it's going to be a fantastic festival of
sport for the UK. I for one cannot wait if I'm involved or not, it's just
going to be a fabulous summer!

I also attended an interview for a Ruby on Rails developer position in Covent
Garden, It was such a beautiful day, and confirmed everything I have thought
about working in London, the buzz of the place and the cosmopolitan lifestyle
is something that really appeals to me. I really hope I get the job!
