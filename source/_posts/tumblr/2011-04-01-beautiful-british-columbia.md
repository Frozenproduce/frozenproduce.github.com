I'm writing this sat in the International Departures lounge at Vancouver
International Airport (YVR). All I can hear is the sound of running water, and
the occasional passenger announcement. Out of the window I can see the snow
covered tops of the nearby Coastal Mountains glistening in the spring
sunshine. The sky is clear and the winds calm, It really is a perfect day.

Part of me is very excited to go back to the UK, but a part of me will always
long to be in this beautiful area of the world. I'll be back Vancouver! But
it's time for my next adventure. I'm just not looking forward to the grimy
80's era international arrivals hall at Heathrow, that'll be a serious shock
to the system!

And to anyone thinking of making the five-thousand mile trip, do it! You won't
be disappointed!
