It's been a while since I posted last, I really need to post at least once a
week. Not a lot has happened really. I'm still unemployed, even though I think
I'm pretty good at what I do it's starting to grate on my confidence. I guess
I'll just keep slogging on.

I'm keeping myself afloat with some freelance jobs, however chasing invoices
is not something I enjoy doing. And why should I have to chase the money that
is owed to me for work that I did in good faith anyway? It's not like this is
a one off, I feel like I should name and shame but I can't quite bring myself
to do it.

In other news I managed to smash my MacBook Pro up. The machine was over four
years old, and it was only a matter of time, so I think the logic board has
burnt out, or something equally expensive. Problem being that I need a Mac in
order to make money, so I had to bite the bullet and order another one from
Apple. On the plus side I ensure I back up everything using Time Machine, so
fortunately all of my work was backed up. If you don't back up, you need to
start now! Data is so much more valuable then hardware!
